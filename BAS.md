My name is Bas Kager and I'm a student Computer Sciences/Software-Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden.

The project, for me, was a conscious choice. As I am a typical 'back-end' developer, I felt like I really needed to challenge myself with front-end tasks to get the most out of this minor.

At the start, we all decided to do this project as a team, so in addition to having challenges, I have been able to make my back-end knowledge useful as well. The combination of my own challenges and my back-end experience made this project one of the most valuable experiences in bachelor. It has allowed me to learn a lot while simultaneously allowing me to fill the 'back-end' gaps where needed.

## Goals and Challenges

Before starting this project I have looked at some reflection reports of older projects to see what I could do better. These are things that I have written about myself or feedback i've received.

### Challenges

- Communicate, plan and delegate better.
- Take more innitiative and bring ideas to the table
- Introduce a back-end perspective into the team.
- Improve code documentation and commenting.

### Goals

- Learn how to build proper CSS layouts with flexbox, grid and best practices.
- Learn more about web design (best) practices.
- Get up to speed with task-runners (later ommitted).
- Learn how to properly deploy a front-end app with Docker and SSL (https) (later added).

### Things I should really stop doing

- Convincing myself I can work from home, this is something I'm just not capable of.
- Focusing too much on my own work (hyperfocus) and being unable to help people because of it.

### Roadblocks

- Insomnia (Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder).
- Medical issues (Dizzy spells, fainting. Heart is currently being researched).
