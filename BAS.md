My name is Bas Kager and I'm a student Computer Sciences/Software-Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden.

The project, for me, was a conscious choice. As I am a typical 'back-end' developer, I felt like I really needed to challenge myself with front-end tasks to get the most out of this minor.

At the start, we all decided to do this project as a team, so in addition to having challenges, I have been able to make my back-end knowledge useful as well. The combination of my own challenges and my back-end experience made this project one of the most valuable experiences in bachelor. It has allowed me to learn a lot while simultaneously allowing me to fill the 'back-end' gaps where needed.

## Goals and Challenges

Before starting this project I have looked at some reflection reports of older projects to see what I could do better. These are things that I have written about myself or feedback I've received.

### Challenges

- Communicate, plan and delegate better.
- Take more initiative and bring ideas to the table
- Introduce a back-end perspective to the team.
- Improve code documentation and commenting.

### Goals

- Learn how to build proper CSS layouts with flexbox, grid and best practices.
- Learn more about web design (best) practices.
- Get up to speed with task-runners (later omitted).
- Learn how to properly deploy a front-end app with Docker and SSL (https) (later added).

### Things I should really stop doing

- Convincing myself I can work from home, this is something I'm just not capable of.
- Focusing too much on my own work (hyperfocus) and being unable to help people because of it.

### Roadblocks

- Insomnia (Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder).
- Medical issues (Dizzy spells, fainting. Heart is currently being researched).

## My contributions

### Project setup and use cases

On the first Monday morning of the project, we started making a MOSCOW list based on the project requirements, so it would be clear what the priorities would be for this project.

**MOSCOW**

I have introduced the MOSCOW methodology to the team because I have used it in projects before and I have always found it useful to have a list of priorities.

**Card sorting**

After listing our priorities we turned the used cases in the MOSCOW list into cards and divided them into pages. This technique was new for me and I quickly found out how useful it is. We were on the first day and we already had ideas on what information this website would offer.

**Database diagram**

Now that we had our cards divided into pages. I offered to make a diagram of the database. I've kept this diagram simple and combined a class diagram with an ERD diagram for ease of reading.

This diagram made clear how the data would be represented. This later turned out very useful for the wireframes as we already had a general idea of what data should be on what page.

### Wireframes

The whole team collaborated on the wireframes. This introduced me to the design process of a proper front-end site and has really opened my eyes. My team members were absolute experts with wireframing and Figma and I've probably learned the most of this process.

We started wireframing on paper and continued with Figma to add more detail.

I have drawn up some elements displayed on the images below.

### Styleguide

The team took my learning goals in mind and allowed me to create a style guide for the website. This style guide provided elements that the rest of the team could work on.

### CSS and HTML layout structure

I have been able to set up the html structure for the homepage and the course page. I have done this alongside Rick and James (pair programming) and they have teached me alot of tips-and-tricks and best-practices along the way.
